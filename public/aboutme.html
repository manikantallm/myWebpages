            Then realised that Economy plays a key role in building the Politics or else Economy lays a strong foundation to the State. Then I realised 
            to earn for my future plans and decided to take employment in the software Industry as salesforce Developer. In my 1st project itself I started
            working with the OMNISTUDIO tool for customization over the salesforce platform. So far I have been part of 2 salesforce projects and unfortuynately
            lost my Job in the recession. Now enrolled myself in the Masters Program for Blockchain with the IIT Kanpur which is about to complete by April 2024.
